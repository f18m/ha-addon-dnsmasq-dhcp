  reset_dhcp_lease_database_on_reboot:
    name: Reset DHCP Lease Database On Reboot
    description: |
      The addon can detect whether the server which is running the addon has just rebooted;
      if that's the case and the following flag is set to "true", then the DHCP lease database
      is reset before starting the DHCP server; this is useful in case a loss of power of the
      HomeAssistant server means also a loss of power of several/all DHCP clients. In such a case
      the old DHCP lease database is not useful and actually misleading.
